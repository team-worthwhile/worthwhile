<h1>Comments</h1>
There are two types of comments:
<ul>
<li>Single line comments begin with '//' and the rest of the line is not part of the program code.</li>
<li>Multi line comments are initiated with '/*' then they reach until the sequence '*/'. Comments are ignored by the interpreter and the prover and are allowed anywhere in the code.</li>
</ul><br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
<pre>
/*I'm a comment
I will not be executed */
Integer a := 42 //Another comment

</pre>
